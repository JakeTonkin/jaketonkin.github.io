  <h1>The Evolution Of Horror Films</h1>
    <h2>WHY WE LOVE TO BE SCARED</h2>


<div class="cont">

    <p>Horror films are a strange phenomenon, aren’t they? Why on earth would anyone spend an hour or so of their life watching a film with the express intention of making themselves terrified? From its emergence in the 1890s, the horror film genre has remained hugely popular and although what scared audiences then may make us laugh now, one thing remains curiously certain; we love to be scared, and we willingly pay for the privilege.</p>

      It’s not easy to put your finger on what exactly is so alluring about horror films, but the thrill and fear that engulfs your body during peak panic-inducing scenes is undeniably addictive. The adrenaline rush that is triggered by this fear is exciting because it is a controlled fear. We know that nothing bad is going to happen to us but we still get to experience the primal reaction to danger that is otherwise rare in our modern lives. The tension that is generated by the terror, shock, and mystery in horror, combined with the knowledge that what we are watching is fictional creates the psychological space where we can enjoy the rush and wait in anticipation for the next zombie to jump out when we least expect it.

    <p>Our fascination with horror stretches back as long as stories have been told. Horror storytelling was (and remains) an art form. Instilling fear from a story that may be illogical or surreal whilst simultaneously making a bold comment on how society functions is a theme that has stood the test of time. Even if we no longer sit around a fire listening to the masterminds with their gory tales, horror has made itself right at home since the advent of film. Since their beginning, they have evolved immensely, and with every new decade comes a new wave of horror film fanatics looking for something original to scare them witless. In the words of Stephen King, one of the greatest horror storytellers of all time, “If movies are the dreams of the mass culture… horror movies are the nightmares.”</p>

    <p>George Méliès, a French director, is awarded with having made the first ever horror film, complete with the devil, a bat, a skeleton and a cauldron. The House of the Devil was released in 1896 and lasts just over three minutes, which was considered very ambitious for the time! Undoubtedly, literary horror tales greatly influenced the formative years of the genre, with Frankenstein hitting the screen in 1910 and The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1923. Two of the first and most notable films born from Germany’s expressionist movement were the silent horror films The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) and Nosferatu (1922). The latter, although silent, premiered with a darkly romantic live orchestral score by Hans Erdmann. They not only explored dark and forbidden themes, but also offered parallel anxieties that contemporary society experienced. Nosferatu was not simply a scary story about vampires that wreaked havoc in a town, but also provided a reflection on the constant worries of premature death, the Great War and the Great Flu.</p>
